 A Fast and Precise Contour-Based Heuristic Vehicle Pose Estimation with LIDAR
### The exzample vedio for the vehicle pose estimation can be found on the [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yp4y1U7Kn/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD0JOG2LZXU).
This reposetary contains the implement detais abount the paper" A Fast and Precise Contour-Based Heuristic Vehicle Pose Estimation with LIDAR".
## Introduction
### The following image denotes the illustration of the process for the geometric shape classifier. (a) shows the processing of endpoints extraction and width
calculation, (b) shows the step of cluster classifying according to extracted contours, the solid blue points in each segment
represent contours. (c) shows a real-world traffic scene on the road, there are various clusters on it, the cluster in black rectangle
represents a symmetrical-like cluster.
